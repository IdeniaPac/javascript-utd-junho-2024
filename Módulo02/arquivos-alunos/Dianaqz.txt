Cantor: Jason Mraz
MÃºsica (93 Million Miles)

93 million miles from the Sun
People get ready, get ready
'Cause here it comes, it's a light
A beautiful light, over the horizon
Into our eyes

Oh, my, my how beautiful
Oh, my beautiful mother
She told me: Son, in life you're gonna go far
If you do it right, you'll love where you are
Just know, wherever you go
You can always come home
